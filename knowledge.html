                    What is C++?

                </header>

                <p>

                    C++ is a general purpose programming

                    language and widely used now a days '

                    for competitive programming. It has

                    imperative, object-oriented and generic

                    programming features. C++ runs on lots of

                    platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.

                    C++ is an efficient

                    and powerful language and finds wide use

                    in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and

                    real-time simulations. Because of the

                    inclusion of rich function libraries,

                    working in C++ becomes simpler and

                    convenient than C. Being object-oriented

                    programming like Java, C++ provides

                    the support of inheritance, polymorphism,

                    encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows

                    exception handling and function overloading.

                </p>

                <p>he “Hello World” program is the first

                    step towards learning any programming

                    language and also one of the simplest

                    programs you will learn. All you have

                    to do is display the message “Hello World”

                    on the screen.

                    <br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>

                </p>

                <code>

                    #include<iostream>  

                    <br>

                    using namespace std;  

                    <br>

                    int main() 

                    <br>

                        { 

                            <br>

                            cout〈〈"Hello World"; 

                            <br>

                            return 0; 

                            <br>

                        } 

                </code>

                <br>

                <p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.

                    <br> The main pillars of Object Oriented

                    Programming are :

                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Objects and Classes</li>

                    <li>Inheritance</li>

                    <li>Polymorphism</li>

                    <li>Abstraction</li>

                    <li>Encapsulation</li>

                </ul>

            </section>

 

            <section class="main-section" id="Object">

                <header>

                    Objects and Classes

                </header>

                <p>

                    Object-oriented programming – As the name

                    suggests uses objects in programming.

                    Object-oriented programming aims to

                    implement real-world entities like

                    inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,

                    etc in programming. The main

                    aim of OOP is to bind together the data

                    and the functions that operate on them

                    so that no other part of the code can

                    access this data except that function.

                </p>

                <p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable

                    entity with some characteristics and behavior.

                    An Object is an instance of a Class. When a

                    class is defined, no memory is allocated but

                    when it is instantiated (i.e. an

                    object is created) memory is allocated.

                    <br>

                    <b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that

                    leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.

                    It is a user-defined data type, which holds its

                    own data members and member functions, which can

                    be accessed & used by creating an instance

                    of that class. A class is like a blueprint for

                    an object. For Example: Consider the Class

                    of Cars. There may be many cars with different

                    names and brand but all of them will share

                    some common properties like all of them will

                    have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.

                    So here, Car is the class and wheels,

                    speed limits, mileage are their properties.

                </p>

            </section>

 

            <section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">

                <header>

                    Inheritance

                </header>

                <p>

                    The capability of a class to derive

                    properties and characteristics from

                    another class is called Inheritance.

                    Inheritance is one of the most important

                    feature of Object Oriented Programming.

                    Sub Class: The class that inherits

                    properties from another class

                    is called Sub class or Derived Class.

                    Super Class: The class whose properties

                    are inherited by sub class is called Base

                    Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we

                    have to write the functions only one time

                    instead of three times as we

                    have inherited rest of the three classes

                    from base class(Vehicle).

                </p>

                <p> 

                    <b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

 

                    <b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub

                    class from a public base class. Then the

                    public member of the base class will

                    become public in the derived class and

                    protected members of the base class

                    will become protected in derived class.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a

                    sub class from a Protected base class.

                    Then both public member and protected

                    members of the base class will become

                    protected in derived class.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a

                    sub class from a Private base class.

                    Then both public member and protected

                    members of the base class will become

                    Private in derived class.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Types of Inheritance in C++ : </b>

                    <br><br><br>

                    <b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single

                    inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit

                    from only one class. i.e. one sub class

                    is inherited by one base class only.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple

                    Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a

                    class can inherit from more than one

                    classes. i.e one sub class is inherited

                    from more than one base classes.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this

                    type of inheritance, a derived class is

                    created from another derived class.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this

                    type of inheritance, more than one sub

                    class is inherited from a single base

                    class i.e. more than one derived class

                    is created from a single base class.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>

                    Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by

                    combining more than one type of

                    inheritance.

                    For example: Combining Hierarchical

                    inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Polymorphism">

                <header>

                    Polymorphism

                </header>

                <p>

                    The word polymorphism means having many

                    forms. In simple words, we can define

                    polymorphism as the ability of a message

                    to be displayed in more than one form.

                    A real-life example of polymorphism, a

                    person at the same time can have

                    different characteristics.

                    Like a man at the same time is a father,

                    a husband, an employee. So the same

                    person posses different behavior in

                    different situations. This is called

                    polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered

                    as one of the important features of Object

                    Oriented Programming.

                    <br>

                    <b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly

                        divided into two types:</b>

                    <br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>

                    2. Runtime Polymorphism

                </p>

 

                <p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of

                    polymorphism is achieved by function

                    overloading or operator overloading.

                    <br> Runtime polymorphism: This type

                    of polymorphism is achieved by

                    Function Overriding.

                </p>

            </section>

 

            <section class="main-section" id="Abstraction">

                <header>

                    Abstraction

                </header>

 

                <p>

                    Data abstraction is one of the most

                    essential and important feature of object

                    oriented programming in C++. Abstraction

                    means displaying only essential information

                    and hiding the details. Data abstraction

                    refers to providing only essential information

                    about the data to the outside world,

                    hiding the background details or implementation.

                    <br> Consider a real life example of a man driving

                    a car. The man only knows that pressing the

                    accelerators will increase the speed of car

                    or applying brakes will stop the car but he

                    does not know about how on pressing accelerator

                    the speed is actually increasing, he does

                    not know about the inner mechanism of the car

                    or the implementation of accelerator, brakes

                    etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.

                </p>

 

                <p>

                    <b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can

                    implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.

                    Class helps us to group data members and member

                    functions using available access specifiers. A

                    Class can decide which data member will be

                    visible to outside

                    world and which is not.

                    <br>

                    <b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One

                    more type of abstraction in C++ can be

                    header files. For example, consider the

                    pow() method present in math.h header file.

                    Whenever we need to calculate power of a

                    number, we simply call the

                    function pow() present in the math.h header

                    file and pass the numbers as arguments

                    without knowing the underlying algorithm

                    according to which the function is actually

                    calculating power of numbers.

                    <br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:

 

                    </b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing

                    the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code

                    duplication and increases reusability.<br>

                    3. Can change internal implementation of

                    class independently without

                    affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to

                    increase security of an application or program

                    as only important details are

                    provided to the user.

                </p>

            </section>

 

            <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">

                <header>

                    Encapsulation

                </header>

                <p>

                    In normal terms Encapsulation is defined

                    as wrapping up of data and information

                    under a single unit. In Object Oriented

                    Programming, Encapsulation is defined as

                    binding together the data and the functions

                    that manipulates them. Consider

                    a real life example

                    of encapsulation, in a company there are

                    different sections like the accounts section,

                    finance section, sales section etc. The finance

                    section handles all the financial transactions

                    and keep records of all the data related to

                    finance.

                    Similarly the sales section handles all the

                    sales related activities and keep records of

                    all the sales. Now there may arise a situation

                    when for some reason an official from finance

                    section needs all the data about sales in a

                    particular

                    month. In this case, he is not allowed to

                    directly access the data of sales section.

                    He will first have to contact some other

                    officer in the sales section and then

                    request him to

                    give the particular data. This is what

                    encapsulation is. Here the data of

                    sales section and the

                    employees that can manipulate them are

                    wrapped under a single name “sales section”.

                </p>

 

                <p>

                    Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction

                    or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides

                    the data. In the above example the data of

                    any of the section like sales, finance or

                    accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>

                    In C++ encapsulation

                    can be implemented using Class

                    and access modifiers.
